# Curse-Build-3

Use A and D to move left and right, Space Bar to jump, Z to throw a grenade, Q to pass throw a portal, and Left Shift to Run. Make it to the glowing point on your left past all the platforms. Once there the level will reset and you might find that you aren't able to beat the level in quite the same way...
